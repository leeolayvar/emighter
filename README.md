# Emighter.js - A simple async-ok event emitter.

## Description

Emighter.js is a simple, and very limited, event emitter. It's only notable
feature is that it is async-ok. That is to say, like Bork.js, if you define
callbacks for event receivers, the emit chain will hold until that callback
is called.

If you need more, for now at least, look elsewhere. No seriously, Emighter
probably isn't for you.

## Installation

If you insist, run this:

```bash
npm install emighter
```

## Examples

Subscribing to emighter events is as basic as you would expect,

```CoffeeScript
emitter.on 'foo', -> console.log 'Foo Called!'
emitter.on 'bar', -> console.log 'Bar Called!'
```

But you also have the option to define a callback function, or explicitly
define options.

```CoffeeScript
# Implicit
emighter.on 'foo', (done) -> console.log "I'm not going to callback"
emighter.on 'foo', -> console.log "I'll never be called, because ^he^ is lazy."

# Explicit
emighter.on 'bar', (-> console.log "I'm explicitly async!"), callback: true
emighter.on 'bar', console.log "I won't be called either :/"
```

And emitting events is also pretty basic, with one notable point. If the
2nd argument is a list, and the 3rd is a function, the 3rd becomes a callback
and the list becomes a list of arguments to pass. See below..

```CoffeeScript
# These examples do not define an emit callback.
emighter.emit 'foo', 1, 2, 3 # Calls `fn 1, 2, 3`
emighter.emit 'foo', [1], 2, 3 # Calls `fn [1], 2, 3`
emighter.emit 'foo', 1, (->), 3 # Calls `fn 1, (->), 3`

# This example defines an emit callback
emighter.emit 'foo', [1, 2, 3], (->) # Calls `fn 1, 2, 3`
emighter.emit 'foo', [], (-> console.log 'Emitter done!') # Calls `fn()`

# Note that additional arguments are added to the arg list.
emighter.emit 'foo', [1], (->), 2, 3 # Calls `fn 1, 2, 3`
emighter.emit 'foo', [], (->), 1, 2, 3 # Calls `fn 1, 2, 3`
```

And i think that sums Emighter up for now. There are currently no extras, such
as pattern matching namespaces, emitting multiple namespaces at once, and etc.
Like i said, you probably don't want to use this library.
